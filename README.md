## üéØ Counter Categories

### Strong Counters ‚≠ê
Cards that:
- Achieve positive elixir trades
- Have direct game-mechanic advantages
- Require minimal or no support
- Create counter-push opportunities

### Moderate Counters ‚úì
Cards that:
- Require decent support or placement
- Achieve roughly even elixir trades
- Have situational effectiveness
- Generate minor positive value

## üí° Strategic Principles

1. **Elixir Efficiency** - Always consider the cost-benefit ratio of your defense
2. **Positioning Matters** - Center vs. side placement changes tower focus
3. **Spell Baiting** - Force opponents to waste spells before deploying squishy units
4. **Glass Cannons** - High DPS but low HP units need support to reach towers
5. **Tanks** - High HP units require supporting damage dealers behind them

## 🎯 Counter Classification Methodology

**Strong Counters (⭐) are classified when they:**
- Achieve positive elixir trades (cost less than opponent's card)
- Have direct game-mechanic advantages (targeting type, speed, damage)
- Require no support to effectively defend
- Generate counter-push opportunities

**Moderate Counters (✓) are classified when they:**
- Require decent support/placement to be effective
- Achieve roughly even elixir trades
- Have situational effectiveness
- Generate minor positive counter-push value

## � Strategic Principles

1. **Elixir Efficiency** - Counters ranked by cost-benefit analysis and trade value
2. **Mechanics Matchups** - Understanding game mechanics (charging, spawning, targeting) is critical
3. **Positioning** - Placement requirements and tower focus determine effectiveness
4. **Support Factor** - Whether a unit needs backing or can standalone defend
5. **Tempo Value** - Ability to create counter-push opportunities after defence
6. **Prediction Mechanics** - Expert players can beat card-level advantages through skill
